00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.440
She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.640
Her dress has got a tear

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.540
She waltzes on her way to mass

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.320
And whistles on the stair

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.220
And underneath her wimple she has curlers in her hair

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.000
I even heard her singing in the abbey

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.840
She's always late for chappel but her penitence is real

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.140
She's always late for everything except for every meal

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.780
I hate to have to say it but I very firmly feel

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.100
Maria's not an asset to the abbey

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.840
I like to say a word in her behalf

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.780
Maria makes me laugh

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.300
How do you solve a problem like Maria

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.380
How do you catch a cloud and pin it down

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.640
How do you find a word that means Maria

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.080
A flibbertijibbet, a will o-the wisp, a clown

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.040
Many a thing you know you like to tell her

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.740
Many a thing she ought to understand

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.220
But how do you make her stay

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.200
And listen to all you say

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340
How do you keep a wave upon the sand

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.220
Oh how do you solve a problem like Maria

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:39.240
How do you hold our moonbeam in your hand?`
